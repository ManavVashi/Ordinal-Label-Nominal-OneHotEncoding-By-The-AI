In this repository I explained
1) Ordinal Encoding
2) Label Encoding
3) Nominal Encoding (One Hot Encoding) with necessry theoritical and prectical concepts in my notebook.

* for Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding refer,
* ordinal-encoding.ipynb notebook
* dataset used: customer.csv

* for Nominal (One Hot) encoding refer,
* nominal-encoding-one-hot-encoding.ipynb notebook
* dataset used: cars.csv 

* Here I took a dataset containing textual data and trained my model from level 0, as the data is testual that dataset also needs Orderd and Nominal(One Hot) Encoding which is also done. for this refer,
* notebook: multiple-linear-regression-textual-data.ipynb
* dataset: Car Price Prediction Textual Dataset.csv
