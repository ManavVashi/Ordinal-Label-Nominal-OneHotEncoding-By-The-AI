# Ordinal-Label-Nominal-OneHotEncoding-By-The-AI 

In this repository, I explained
1) Ordinal Encoding
2) Label Encoding
3) Nominal Encoding (One Hot Encoding) with necessary theoretical and practical concepts in my notebook.

#
1. Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding
* Notebook: ordinal-encoding. ipynb
* Dataset: customer.csv

2. Nominal (One Hot) encoding
* Notebook: nominal-encoding-one-hot-encoding. ipynb
* Dataset: cars.csv 

#
3. Here I took a dataset containing textual data and trained my model from level 0, as the data is testual that dataset also needs Orderd and Nominal(One Hot) Encoding which is also done. for this refer,
* Notebook: multiple-linear-regression-textual-data. ipynb
* Dataset: Car Price Prediction Textual Dataset.csv
